### Data base:  `A storage area to store Collection of information`
* FMS (File management system)
  * AFMS is a type of software that manages data files in a computer system. It has limited capabilities and designed to manage individual or group of files.
  
  * Advantages:
    * The performance is very high
    * It is easy to maintain
    
  * Limitations
    * It has low security
    
* DBMS or RDBMS
  * Database management system is a software for storing and retrieving user's information while considering appropriate security measures. And it follows a structure to store the information. We've to follow a language for communicating with it such as sql (Structured query language)
  * Advantages
    * It maintains security
    * Stores information in structured order
    
  * Limitations
    * The performance is very slow
    * Somewhat complex to maintain
    
  * Examples:
    * Oracle
    * mySql
    
* Nosql (Not only sql)
  ` FMS + DBMS `
  The combination of security and the performance.
  * Examples:
    * Mongo
    * Firebase
